## <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/decafdev"><img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" width="200" /></a><br> I'm Bradley [@decafdev](https://github.com/decafdeveloper). Knowledge is power, so they say.   

I'm a passionate coder from Sheffield üá¨üáß (well, originally from Manchester, long story) and I'm trained in software development such as JavaScript, React, Node, Express, and so on üí™üèº. My current journey being a front-end developer gives me the opportunities to show my creative side where i can be hands-on with UI/UX üé®.      

When i'm away from the keyboard i have a variety of passionate hobbies which include: competitive gaming üïπ, blackball pool player üé± and event DJ üéß. I'm one of them inconspicuous geeks... I like Harry Potter, Pok√©mon, 90's music and rom-coms ü§ì.

<br>
  From school I had a thirst for knowledge in technology. Despite only a brief stint on a computer hardware course at Bury College i would later find mentorship and teaching from a close friend in Tony Higham. Tony taught me the fundamentals in Visual Basic 6 and in an era of Yahoo! chat rooms and MSN Messenger i would program social tools.  
<br/><br/>
  In 2004 I did a little web design training using Macromedia (Adobe CC <em>it's called these days</em> üôÑ ) learning HTML & CSS. My web design teacher Dave Jones (Pride Media, Middleton) introduced me to performing as a DJ and how to use Cool Edit Pro 2 <em>another Adobe product now</em> called Adobe Audition) and my life as a mashup artist and DJ began. Shortly after I created a community board using vBulletin software dedicated to music artists - LiteRECORDS (2010). Skip a decade or so and I wanted to return to coding so we're up-to-speed.

### LiteRECORDS
[LiteRECORDS](https://literecords.com) started out as a pet project in 2010 and become my classroom and foundation for learning large-scale web development. Since 2010 it's had 4 complete front end design overhauls and over 30 features and services built along the way. The [LiteRECORDS](https://literecords.com) community now hosts over 33,000 members worldwide and has an average annual revenue of ¬£6,500. It was here I began my understanding of JavaScript, PHP and XML with vBulletin hack. This project displays the Shoutcast server details from XML, fetches the user details from MySQL database and refreshes the details and online indication with AJAX.
