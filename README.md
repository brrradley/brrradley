<summary>More on my history</summary>
<br>
My web design teacher introduced me to performing as a DJ and how to use Cool Edit Pro 2 (another Adobe product now - Adobe Audition) and my life as a mashup artist and DJ began. Shortly after I created a community board using vBulletin software dedicated to music artists - LiteRECORDS (est 2010). Skip a decade or so and I wanted to return to coding.
