Hiya 👋🏼 ! I am a passionate coder from 🇬🇧 Sheffield, UK. In 2004 I progressed through web design training using Macromedia (Adobe CC these days 🙄 ) learning HTML & CSS. Today though i code in VSCode with React and Javascript 💪🏼.

My web design teacher introduced me to performing as a DJ and how to use Cool Edit Pro 2 (another Adobe product now - Adobe Audition) and my life as a mashup artist and DJ began. Shortly after I created a community board using vBulletin software dedicated to music artists - LiteRECORDS (est 2010). Skip a decade or so and I wanted to return to coding.
