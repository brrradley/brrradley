## Hiya, I'm Bradley aka [@enitial](https://github.com/enitial). Knowledge is power, so they say.
👋🏼 I'm a passionate coder from 🇬🇧 Sheffield. Trained in web development: JavaScript, React, Node, Express, and so on 💪🏼. I've returned to my journey to be a full-stack web developer and software developer one day ⏱. I'm one of them inconspicuous geeks, I like Harry Potter, Pokémon, 90's music and rom-coms 🤓

<summary>More on my history</summary>
<br>
  From school I had a thirst for knowledge in technology. Despite only a brief stint on a computer hardware course at Bury College i would later find mentorship and teaching from a close friend in Tony Higham. Tony taught me the fundamentals in Visual Basic 6 and in an era of Yahoo! chat rooms and MSN Messenger i would program social tools.  
<br/><br/>
  In 2004 I did a little web design training using Macromedia (Adobe CC *it's called these days* 🙄 ) learning HTML & CSS. My web design teacher Dave Jones (Pride Media, Middleton) introduced me to performing as a DJ and how to use Cool Edit Pro 2 (*another Adobe product now* called Adobe Audition) and my life as a mashup artist and DJ began. Shortly after I created a community board using vBulletin software dedicated to music artists - LiteRECORDS (est 2010). Skip a decade or so and I wanted to return to coding so we're up-to-speed.
